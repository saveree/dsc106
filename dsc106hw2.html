    <p> <i><b>Dear CEO,</b></i>
        we respect the pride you take in the food we serve here at McDonald's. To further increase investor confidence, we, the data team, have derived some data driven insights and are ready to present them to you. Ever since Burger King introduced the Impossible Burger, market trends at McDonalds were affected. Today we’d like to show you <b>two</b> trends we have come across in our market analysis & how the impossible burger’s release has made an impact. </p>
    <h1>1. Micro/Macro Trends </h1>
        <h2><i>The immediate decline in McDonalds item sales </i></h2>
    <img src="graph1.png">
    <p>The first macro/micro trend is simple. The release of Burger King’s impossible burger in October 2018 drastically reduced sales for the McDonald’s hamburgers, chicken fillets, and fish fillets in all regions of the country. It is more visible in the hamburger sales, which are at the top of the graph. The line plot shows the decrease around 33 in the x-axis, which indicates October 2018. When the impossible burger was first launched, we can see that the sales did decrease at McDonalds. After the launch of this new burger, McDonald’s has started to recover their losses, but they are still aiming to reach the peak that they were at in September 2018. On a larger scale, it is safe to conclude that the impossible burger at Burger King has definitely led to an overall decrease in McDonald's sales.</p>

    <h1>2. Geographical Trends</h1>
        <h2><i>The constantly soaring sales in all regions decline rapidly due to the introduction of the impossible burger </i></h2>

                <div class="column">
                  <img src="graph2a.png" style="width:100%">
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                  <img src="graph2b.png" style="width:100%">
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                  <img src="graph2c.png" style="width:100%">
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                        <img src="graph2d.png" style="width:100%">
                </div>
              </div>  
    
    <p>All four regions reacted in almost the same way to the release of the Impossible burger. With the plots by region side-by-side, we can see that the hamburger has been the most popular item on the menu. If you closely notice on the region around the 33rd index again (which is October 2018), you can see that the hamburger sale declines from roughly 1606160 to 1380063 burgers in the northeast region from October to November 2018. This proves that the impossible burger’s release impacted the nation in the same way. Despite of the region of the country we were in, the impossible burger lowered McDonald’s sales. This could be due to the fact that the customers who were ordering vegetarian versions of the pre-existing McDonald’s items were given an option of experiencing a similar, and more fulfilling option of the Impossible burger at Burger King. Or, it could be from meat-loving customers having an incentive to save animals while being able to experience the same taste. There could be several reasons behind the decline of the McDonald’s sales throughout the country, but the fact to note is that it impacted all four regions of the country in the same way. But, it is no coincidence that the decline took place in the specific month of the release of the impossible burger.
